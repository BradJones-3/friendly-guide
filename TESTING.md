## Testing User Stories

### **Players Goals**:
  * I want to be able to, access straightforward instructions on how to play the game.
    * The rules are easily accessable from the homepage modal and are brief and straightforward to understand in a matter of seconds.
  * I want to be able to, return to the homepage with a single click.
    * This is easily achieved by clicking on the logo placed in the top center of every page and will direct the player to the homepage of the website instantly.
  * I want to be able to, challenge myself with various stages of the game.
    * The game comes in 3 levels all described in the rules section of the homepage modal telling the players what each level will consist of, all levels have different time restrictions too.
  * I want to be able to, play the game with or without audio.
   * Developer ran out of time when coming to implement this feature on the website, which is disappointing as they woudl of included more iconic quotes from the franchise of Star Wars.
