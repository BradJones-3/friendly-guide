  * I want to be able to, access straightforward instructions on how to play the game.
    * The rules are easily accessable from the homepage modal and are brief and straightforward to understand in a matter of seconds.
  * I want to be able to, return to the homepage with a single click.
    * This is easily achieved by clicking on the logo placed in the top center of every page and will direct the player to the homepage of the website instantly.
  * I want to be able to, challenge myself with various stages of the game.
    * The game comes in 3 levels all described in the rules section of the homepage modal telling the players what each level will consist of, all levels have different time restrictions too.
  * I want to be able to, play the game with or without audio.
