## Design

### Colour Scheme

The main colours used throughout the website are a black background with yellow text to keep the Star Wars theme consistant throughout each page. Also when hovering over buttons the colour will change to a orange to clearly show the user where their cursor is pointing.

### Typography

The pairing of fonts [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text_type=custom) and also [Gothic+A1](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gothic+A1) with Sans Serif being used as back-up should the fonts not be able to load due to an import fail.

Gothic A1 is being used throughout the site to keep the text consistent.
