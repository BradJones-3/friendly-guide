# Introduction

This game was designed as part of the Full Stack Developer course the developer is taking at Code Institute. The focus of the game is to develop peoples memory and to also ensure they're having fun whilst playing.

This is the first of four Milestone Projects for the developer that they must complete during their Full Stack Web Development Program at the Code institute.

The main languages that will be used during this project will be HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

# UX

## Ideal User Demographic

* The main requirements for this project were to create a fun, easily playable and interactive game that would be enjoyed by anyone playing. The content in this game will be suitable for all ages. The target audience is considerable of all ages, though the game may appeal more to people interested in science fiction content and more specifically fans of the franchise Star Wars.

## Skeleton

The developer used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamiq Homepage") to create the wireframes for the website.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The main colours used throughout the website are a black background with yellow text to keep the Star Wars theme consistent throughout each page. Also when hovering over buttons the colour will change to a orange to clearly show the user where their cursor is pointing.

### Typography

The pairing of fonts [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text_type=custom) and also [Gothic+A1](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gothic+A1) with Sans Serif being used as back-up should the fonts not be able to load due to an import fail.

Gothic A1 is being used throughout the site to keep the text consistent.

## Features

### Design Features

* Each page on the website has a logo placed at the top of the page and in the center for consistent flow throughout and when clicked will take the players back to the homepage. 

* Every page also has a footer placed at the bottom of the page which has the developers GitHub page, the official Star Wars YouTube page, the sub-Reddit page for Star Wars and finally the developers LinkedIn page. When players click upon either of the icons, they will be taken to the relevant page of the icon clicked which will also open in a new tab.

### Existing Features

* **Header Logo** - This appears on every page of the website for brand recognition, always located in the top center of the page and will allows players of the website to click on the logo to be returned to the homepage as they would expect.

* **Footer Social Icons** - The footer will be located at the bottom of each page and will allow the website users to be able to easily navigate to each of the social handles that they wish to

### Future Features 

* **Leaderboard**
  * **Feature** - Set up a modal dedicated to scoring the players attempts on every level and implement a score based on how many moves and the time left on the clock when the game is completed.
  * **Reasons For Not Implementing** - Developer ran out of time due to work commitments.

* **Game Sounds**
  * **Feature** - Set up game sounds based on player actions and results of the game.
  * **Reasons For Not Implementing** - Didn't want to overwhelm the players with game sounds on every move.

## Issues And Bugs
 The developer came across multiple bugs when implementing some features on the website, the ones that was more noticeable, along with the solutions are listed below:

**Footer Overlapping Content** - When looking at game on smaller devices the footer would overlap the game cards. Developer used Google to try and find an answer on how to fix this issue and found the solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16244821/how-to-stop-sticky-footer-from-covering-content).

**Modal stacking on top of one another** - When players clicked the homepage button to open the first modal when they tried to start a new game both modals would stack on top of one another, the developer found that the way they had tried to implement the modal was wrong and deleted the modals and started a fresh making. [Modal Solution](https://codepen.io/elmahdim/details/azVNbN/) developer used this website as a reference as to where they were going wrong.
